# Challenge 02 - Land Ho! - Coach's Guide

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-01.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-03.md)

## Notes & Guidance

This challenge implements the design developed in Challenge 1, landing data in a "raw" format ready to import in [the next Challenge](./Solution-03.md).


## Solution

Notebooks were used to download the datasets discussed in [Challenge 1](./Solution-01.md), using examples from the source documentation. See the notebooks in the [Solutions](./Solutions) folder and details in [Solution 3](./Solution-03.md).

More advanced students might like to include climate (temperature and wave) models from  [ECMWF Open Data](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/ecmwf-forecast) available via the Microsoft Planetary Computer. An example notebook is included in the [Solutions](./Solutions) folder.

Depending on the skill set of the group, coding automated retrieval may prove challenging. It's OK to skip ahead and to manually download datasets. The important thing is to have attempted this challenge, and the data ready in OneLake for the next.
